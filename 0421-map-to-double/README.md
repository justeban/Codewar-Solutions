# Use map() to double the values in an array

## Problem Domain 

Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object.

e.g.

```javascript
var someNumbers = [1,2,10,57];

double(someNumbers); // should return [2,4,20,114]
```
